* **Instructions:**

  * In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include the following in it:

    * DOCTYPE declaration
    * Head tag with a title tag
    * H1 tag with a title of your choice
    * Embed an image
    * Create the following three links on your page:
      * One link that is `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
      * Make the second link bold.
      * Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.

  

  * Bonus:
    * Create an ordered list of steps to build a fire.
    * Create an unordered list of 5 things you like.
    * Create a table with 2 columns (city and location) and 4 rows of cities.
    * Use an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.
    * Embed a Youtube video of something you like.
